# **Style Rules**

## **Naming:**

  File extension names shoud always be lower case, unless the file extension name is case dependent.
  Variable names should be clear and accuratly reflect the purpose of the variable.

## **Indentation:**

  For indents DO NOT use tabs. Tabs will create a inconsistant view of the file across diffrent IDEs, so instead; use double space. In most IDEs you can configure your tab button to a double spacing.

## **Grammer:**

  Grammer conventions are based of AMERICAN English.
  Do your best with spelling, if you cant spell you can still add code just add like a comment or something saying that the spelling is  wrong so someone else can fix it later. Spelling is based off of AMERICAN English.

## **Syntax:**

  This is for syntax of the code not human language (See: Grammer)
  When writing math, use comments to explain the math and the process.
  Only use capital variable names if the variable is a proper noun. (See: Grammer)
  For markdown use [Markdown Lint](https://https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint)
  Use [Linter](https://https://github.com/fnando/vscode-linter) for general linting.
